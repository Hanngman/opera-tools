Patch Opera 15 or 16 to support more speed dial columns and smaller/larger preview images, and injects custom CSS styles into internal pages.

#Usage
1. exit Opera
2. run **SpeedDialPatch.exe**
3. locate your Opera installation folder containing **launcher.exe**
4. enter speed dial configuration values
5. run Opera again

You have to delete and add again default speed dial entries (like Facebook, YouTube, etc.) if you disable built-in speed dial preview images.

Because this tool modifies the **opera.pak** file, you must run it after each Opera update
