Patch Opera 15 or 16 to support more speed dial columns and smaller/larger preview images. 

#Usage
1. exit Opera
2. run **SpeedDialPatch.exe**
3. locate your Opera installation folder containing **launcher.exe**
4. enter speed dial configuration values
5. run Opera again

You have to delete and add again default speed dial entries (like Facebook, YouTube, etc.) if you disable built-in speed dial preview images.

Because this tool modifies the **opera.pak** file, you must run it after each Opera update

#Requirements
1. *XP only:* install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 if it is not installed already
